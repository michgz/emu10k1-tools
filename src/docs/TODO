o	put support for midi in different modules (maybe)

o	add a dsp ioctl to query and modify the parameters of the voice (mono or
	stereo) associated with the /dev/dsp file descriptor.
	Things to control:
	- routing. FXRT_CHANNELx
	- ...

o	provide a way to accuratly synchronize a group of voices. This seems
	essential for proper hardware voice mixing.

o	Go back to using voice interrupts. The timer doesn't work on Alpha
	and it makes it hard to handle dynamic pitch shifting.

o	add support for secondary AC97 codecs present in some card models
	(need info from Creative)

o	add support for common analog/digital jack present in some Gateway OEM card models
        (need info from Creative and/or Gateway)

o	implement proper locking for the patch manager. Needs rewriting to load
	all the patches in a single pass. 

o	Consider getting rid of DSP_COPR_LOAD and just stick with the MIXER_PRIVATE ioctl's

o	Add documentation for IR remote control

o	Add documentation for mixer and patch management system
